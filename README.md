# Australia-weather-forecast

This repository is the final project of the Machine Learning with Python course.

A predictive model has been implemented on the Wheater dataset to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. The dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from different locations in Australia.
